Interview-Code-Samples
======================
A few examples of my code work;

Book: has the code written for an interview when I was asked to learn Django and implement a basic book Django App in Python. Has ~3 hours of work in it; from knowing nothing about Django to building a simple tool that can interface with a database, display simple views, import structured data from a .json file, and has all the underlying class structure info in the models file.

Simple_Examples: has a couple small applets that I've written (a tool for doing common dictionary operations, a FIFO data type, etc.)
